###########################################################################
#
#  Purpose:
#
#      This script is a wrapper around the process 
#	that does QC checks for the QTL to QTL Interaction Load
#
#  Usage:
#
#      qtlIntQC.sh  filename  
#
#      where
#          filename = full path to the input file
#
#  Env Vars:
#
#      See the configuration file
#
#  Inputs:
#	QTL Interactions file
#
#  Outputs:
#
#      - QC report for the input file 	
#      - Log file (${QC_LOGFILE})
#
#  Exit Codes:
#
#      0:  Successful completion
#      1:  Sanity error (prompt to view sanity report)
#      2:  Unexpected error occured running qtlIntQC.py (prompt to view log)
#      3:  QC errors (prompt to view qc report)
#
#  Assumes:  Nothing
#
#  Implementation:
#
#      This script will perform following steps:
#
#      1) Validate the arguments to the script
#      2) Validate & source the configuration files to establish the environment
#      3) Verify that the input file exists
#      4) Update path to QC reports if this is not a 'live' run 
#	     i.e. curators running the scripts 
#      5) Initialize the log file
#      6) Call qtlIntQC.py to generate the QC report
#
#
#  Notes:  None
